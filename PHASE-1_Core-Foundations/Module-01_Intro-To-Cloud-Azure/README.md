# 📘 Module 1: Introduction to Cloud & Azure

## 🌥️ What is Cloud Computing?

Before diving into cloud computing, let’s first understand how applications were traditionally hosted and accessed. Think about websites and services we use daily, like:

- 🌐 [www.google.com](https://www.google.com)  
- 🛒 [www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com)  
- 📦 [www.flipkart.com](https://www.flipkart.com)  

All of these are applications — and behind every application is **hardware** running somewhere to serve it.

---

### 📱 A Simple Analogy: Your Mobile Phone

Let’s take a basic example: **your smartphone**.

- Your phone is a **hardware device**.
- It has an **operating system** like Android or iOS.
- You install apps like WhatsApp, YouTube, or Instagram.
- These apps run on the phone, using its **storage**, **CPU**, and **RAM** — all of which are part of the hardware.

Similarly, websites like Amazon or Google are applications — but instead of running on your phone, they run on **servers**. A **server** is just a more powerful hardware system, designed to host applications for many users at once.

---

### 🏢 Before Cloud Computing: The Traditional Way

So, how did companies host applications before the cloud?

1. They **bought physical servers** (hardware).
2. Set them up in **data centers** — which required:
   - 🏬 Dedicated buildings
   - 🔌 Uninterrupted power supply (24/7/365)
   - ❄️ Cooling systems
   - 👨‍💻 IT staff to maintain everything
3. This meant **huge capital investments** — known as **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)**.

Even before launching an application, organizations had to:
- Forecast how much traffic they would get
- Buy enough servers to handle peak load (even if most of the time, the load was less)

This model was expensive, rigid, and hard to scale.

---

### ☁️ Enter Cloud Computing

In 2006–2007, **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** introduced the concept of the **public cloud**.

In this model:

- A **cloud provider** (like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud) manages all the physical hardware, power, networking, and security.
- As a **customer**, you only rent what you need — like:
  - A virtual machine (instead of buying a full server)
  - Storage space (instead of physical hard drives)
  - A database service (without installing database software)

You access these services **over the internet**, and pay **only for what you use** — like electricity or water.

This is called **Cloud Computing**.

### ✅ Benefits of Cloud Computing

| Traditional Model           | Cloud Model               |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Buy physical servers        | Rent virtual resources     |
| Large upfront cost (CapEx)  | Pay-as-you-go (OpEx)       |
| Manual scaling              | Automatic scaling          |
| Maintenance responsibility  | Provider handles maintenance |
| Long setup time             | Instant provisioning       |

### 💡 A Layman Example: Hosting a Website

Let’s say you want to start a blog.

**Before Cloud**:  
You’d need to buy a server, connect it to the internet, set up everything manually.

**With Cloud**:  
You go to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com), create a virtual machine or App Service in a few clicks, and your blog is live in minutes.

### 🏷️ Major Public Cloud Providers

Today, the big players in the public cloud space are:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** – First and largest
- **Microsoft Azure** – Strong enterprise integration
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** – Focus on AI/ML and analytics

## 🌍 Azure Global Infrastructure

---

### 📌 What is Azure Global Infrastructure?

Microsoft Azure is not just a cloud—it’s a **global network of powerful data centers**, connected by one of the fastest and most secure networks in the world. This global infrastructure ensures that Azure can deliver **high availability, redundancy, performance**, and **compliance** to customers around the world.

---

### 🧱 Key Components of Azure Infrastructure

#### 1. **Regions**
- A **region** is a geographical area (like **Central India**, **East US**, or **West Europe**) that contains at least **two or more data centers**.
- When you deploy resources in Azure, you choose a region closest to your users to reduce latency.

> 🧠 *Example:* If you're building an app for users in Mumbai, you might choose the **Central India** region.

#### 2. **Availability Zones**
- A region may have **Availability Zones** — physically separate data centers within the same region.
- These help protect apps and data from **data center failures**.
- Each zone has its own power, cooling, and network.

> 🔐 *Think of it like 3 different bank branches in the same city. If one goes down, others still work.*

#### 3. **Data Centers**
- These are the physical buildings housing the servers.
- Microsoft manages these with strict physical security and environmental controls.

#### 4. **Region Pairs**
- Azure pairs each region with another (e.g., **Central India** with **South India**) for **disaster recovery** and **data replication**.

> 🔁 If a whole region goes down due to a natural disaster, Azure automatically fails over to its pair.

---

### 🌐 Network Reach

- Azure operates in **60+ regions** and is available in **140+ countries**.
- Microsoft owns the **fiber optic cables** that connect these regions—ensuring fast global connectivity.

### ✅ Benefits of Azure's Infrastructure

| Feature       | Benefit                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Global Reach  | Deploy apps close to users, improve speed |
| Redundancy    | Built-in backups via zones and region pairs |
| Compliance    | Meets local data regulations in various countries |
| Low Latency   | Data served from nearest region           |
